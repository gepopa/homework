1. Exercise #1 : Finding defects 
As we previously spoke on our last meeting, we identified that a defect can be described 
also by a severity and a priority. Please give 3 examples each, where: 
- priority is high & severity is low 
- priority is low & severity is high 
- both are high 
- both are low							
							
							
							
							
High priority & low severity	If we have a bad spelling on the company's name or the wrong
Logo on the first screen of our app, 
is not a high severity because the app still works, 
but is definitely a high priority for the image of the product and the company						
							
	Story for translation integration, with missing translated words						
							
	Missing blur effect on splash screen after the redesign of the splash screen						
							
							
Low priority & high severity	When we have a crash in a very complex flow, and maybe only on a single model of device,
We have a High severity defect, but is low priority because a normal user will not do that flow.
Ex: we have a Google Pixel with Android 9.0
One app (Portrait mode only),with 7 subapps, and the defect reproduces only if I enter in 
Landscape mode on one specific subapp, then with the phone still in landscape mode,
I open a second specific subbapp, theeen the app crashes :D true story						
							
	Missing parts of the screen on a flow that is very difficult to access						
							
	A deffect for a premium subscription flow for a product that nobody use						
							
							
High priority & high severity	If we have a story to implement a button to open something
And the button is not there :D						
							
	If we have a crash o a usual flow						
							
	If the redirection for an activation link is wrong						
							
							
Low priority & low severity	Spelling defect						
							
	Not traslated strings in polish for an italian app						
							
	Wrong text collor for a non usual flow

2. Exercise #2 : Writing test scenarios - 30 minutes 
Create test cases for a mobile app(for reference you can use shazam app, 
the song discovery feature, sharing the song through social media apps 
& lyrics being displayed on the device) 

- here include elements like priority of considered tests
(prioritization - most important tests are done first - slide 11)
 - acceptance data (slide 11)
 - think of acceptance criteria, coverage criteria (slide 11)
- consider everything :)
